    <h2>Some Thoughts on AI</h2>

    <p>AI is an extremely effective tool for generating a <strong>lot</strong> of code, <strong>fast</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <em>
            <p>Me: "You have to help me. I need a hundred barrels of code, by tonight! Oh god, this is a nightmare, my boss is gonna kill me if I don't-"</p>
            <p>AI: "Take a chill pill man. I've got two hundred barrels of code, right here."</p>
            <p>Me: "Wow. That was... really quick. Where did all this come from?"</p>
            <p>AI: "Fell off the back of a truck."</p>
        </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>AI gets you 60% of the way to completion in the blink of an eye. And for plenty of projects, 60% of the way may as well be <strong>all</strong> the way. Do you need five nines of reliability for a demo? Do you need bulletproof security for a tool you'll only use once? Do you even need it to <strong>work</strong> more than one time? <strong>Do you even need it to work at all?</strong></p>

    <p>It's just, you know, how often has a piece of code only ever been used <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/">once</a>?</p>
