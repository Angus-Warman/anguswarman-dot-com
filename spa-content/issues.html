        <h3>This is a dependency nightmare waiting to happen</h3>

        <p>And the way the rest of the industry handles code... isn't? The current professional standard is to import nigh-unlimited quantities of packages before a project gets off the ground, in order to manage the development state and package management life-cycle of the entire project.</p>

        <p>Or something like that.</p>

        <h3>Skill issue</h3>

        <p>Yeah. I find web development tricky. If I can't physically boot a misbehaving computer out the window, I struggle to get it to do what I want. Coming into the web-dev landscape in the Year 2026 means I haven't been in the Javascript Trenches. I never had to battle against the unkillable gasping corpse of IE6. Animations and transitions and hover effects all get delivered to me on a silver CSS platter.</p>

        <p>So I see all of this infrastructure, hear about the nightmares of the 2010's, and think... why?</p>

        <p>And then, why not?</p>
